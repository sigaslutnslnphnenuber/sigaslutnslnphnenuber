If you are absolutely adverse to having your credit pulled, you still have a few options for obtaining bad credit personal loans, some of which include secured loans:

Payday Loan – We’ve already discussed this, but in addition to using an online lending platform such MoneyMutual or CashAdvance.com, you can visit a local payday center and receive a quick cash loan in minutes if you meet the lender’s income requirements.
Auto Title Loan – This requires you to own a car and have the title in your name. You can use the title as collateral to secure a loan, but this loan type is especially risky. If you fail to repay, you lose your vehicle.
Pawnshop Loan – If you own valuable property that you don’t want to sell, such as electronics or jewelery, you can use it as collateral to secure a loan from a pawnbroker. The problem with this loan, however, is that you’ll usually receive far less for the item than what it’s worth. But you’ll get the item back as soon as you repay the loan.
Friends or Family Loan – You may have already considered this, but if you have someone you trust (and who trusts you), you may be able to borrow a few dollars to hold you over, and these unsecured loans usually come interest free.
Cash Advance Apps – A fairly new entrant to the loan space, cash advance apps allow you to get an advance on your next paycheck right from your phone, with no credit check and sometimes with no interest. The requirements vary by service, but you usually need to connect your bank account to the app so it can automatically withdraw the funds when you get paid.
